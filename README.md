# IliadBulletHellGame

IliadBulletHellGame is a bullet hell game based on the Iliad. I created this simple game as a final project for Comparative Literature. You play as Achilles during the last few books of the Iliad. Your objective is to defeat the Trojans and the final boss, Hector.

How to play:

WASD - movement

Space - throw a javelin  




I do not own any of the game assets. I have modified some of the sprites as well.
